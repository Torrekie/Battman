# Updating on macOS

A native macOS version of Battman is **not yet available**. This page documents the expected behavior once macOS support is implemented.

## Planned behavior

- Battman for macOS will likely be distributed as a signed app bundle or via a package manager.
- Updating should follow the usual macOS patterns (replacing the app in `/Applications` or using the package manager’s update command).

Until a macOS build ships, there is nothing to update here. Please refer to **Updating → iOS** for current, supported platforms.
