# Preferred Languages

Battman and this user manual are designed to be **multi‑lingual**.

## App UI

- Battman follows the iOS system language order by default.
- Where multiple localizations are available, iOS will automatically pick the best match, otherwise uses English as fallback.

## Documentation site

- This site uses MkDocs with a language suffix scheme: `index.md` for English, `index.zh.md` for Simplified Chinese.
- Use the language switcher in the top‑right corner to change documentation language without changing system settings.

If a string or page is missing in your language, you can help by contributing translations (see **Contributing → Locales**).
