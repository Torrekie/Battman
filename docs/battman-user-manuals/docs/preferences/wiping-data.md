# Wiping Data

This page explains how to clear Battman’s local data and settings.

## What "data" means here

- Battman’s own preferences (stored in the app container or system preferences).
- Cached logs or temporary files created by the app.

!!! note "Important"
    Battman would never reset systemwide configurations (Thermal Tunes, etc.) for stability concerns, please make your own backups when possible.

## Steps to wipe data

1. Open Battman
2. Tap "More" tab.
3. Tap "Preferences".
4. Scroll to bottom, you will see **Wipe all Battman data**.
5. Tap on it and confirm to wipe all Battman data.

For uninstalling Battman, see **Uninstallation**.
