# Nits & Percentages

Battman shows brightness both as a **user percentage** and, where possible, as approximate **nits**.

## Why they differ

- The system slider is not linear in nits; the same percentage can map to different physical brightness on different panels.
- Physical nits depend on the device model, HDR status, and whether the device is in sunlight‑boost mode.
- Auto‑brightness and Night Shift / True Tone can further change the perceived brightness.

## In Battman

- The **Brightness** metrics page shows the current percentage plus any known hardware limits.
