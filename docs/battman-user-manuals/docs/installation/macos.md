# Installation on macOS

macOS support for Battman is planned but the native macOS UI has **not been implemented yet**.

For now, Battman primarily targets jailbroken or TrollStore-enabled iOS devices. Some low‑level components and libraries may build on macOS or Apple‑silicon Macs for development and testing, but there is no end‑user macOS GUI.

## Current status

- No official macOS app bundle or installer is provided.
- Core libraries may compile on macOS 11+ for internal development.
- Thermal and battery‑related APIs on macOS are still under investigation.

## When macOS support arrives

This page will describe:

- System requirements (macOS version, supported Macs).
- How to install Battman for macOS (download, verify and run).
- Notes about sandboxing, permissions and data directories.

In the meantime, please follow the iOS installation guide for supported devices.
